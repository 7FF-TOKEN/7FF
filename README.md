# 7FF
7-24 FOR FUN TOKEN


Intro**

The Rise of Bitcoin in the last years has shown that cryptocurrency gets more and more accepted worldwide. And that's just the beginning.  The Future for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies looks great. 

In under 15 years Bitcoin was growing from an asset with worth of a few cents to a major asset on the market with a worth of over  20.000 Dollar per Coin. This price comes through his low supply and the acceptance that grows every day worldwide. Big Investors, Banks and Companies work more and more with cryptocurrency and other digital assets.

The next 10, 20 or even 30 or 40 years we all will really see what potential and limits cryptocurrency really has. Today Bitcoin is integrated and that process will never stop. Every day the world wide web grows and with that the cryptocurrency market.

[7FF] was created as a huge long term project with enough savings for the next 30 years. Well calculated and planned with knowledge about the Exchange listing process and costs as well, we can guarantee a good deployment, long term market integration and new exchange listings for a long time.

Cryptocurrency is a great way for fast payments worldwide. A transfer needs a few minutes and not a few days. Cryptocurrency doesn't know about any borders or crises. 

Cryptocurrency is more than just an asset. Cryptocurrency can't get regulated by any government. Transfers can be done simple, fast and anonymous. People can store their funds online, get independent from our banking system and in good times can take some profits or stock up their portfolio. 

The 7FF Team welcomes you to follow us on our journey. Don't miss the chance to be a part of us from the beginning. On the following sites we will inform you over technical details, development plannings, community standards and the coin/presale calculation.

Token Created BEP20 Descriptions**

BEP-20 is a token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. Due to its similarity to Binance Chain’s BEP-2 and Ethereum’s ERC-20, it’s compatible with both. BEP-20 was conceived as a technical specification for Binance Smart Chain, with the goal of providing a flexible format for developers to launch a range of different tokens. Like BEP-2 tokens on Binance Chain, BEP-20 token transfers are fueled with BNB. This provides an incentive for validators to include the transactions in the blockchain, as they’ll collect the BNB as a fee for their troubles.

Gas Fees
Compared to the Ethereum Network, BEP20 is a clear winner over ERC20 when it comes to gas fees. Due to BSC’s PoSA (Proof of Stake Authority) block validation method, the transaction fee for the BEP20 token is much lower than ERC20. The average transaction fee charged by ERC20 is around 50 cents, whereas BEP20 tokens don’t cost more than a few cents at the time of transaction. The intrinsic value of Ethereum is much higher than BSC. While carrying out transactions using ERC20 tokens, users have to pay the gas fees in Ethereum and find it a bit costlier when compared to BEP20.
Block Verification Speed
Transaction speed or Block verification speed for both ERC20 and BEP20 tokens varies largely. The PoSA block validation method gives BEP20 transactions a faster execution speed as compared to transactions conducted through ERC20. The average block verification speed on the underlying Blockchains is approximately 3 seconds for BSC and close to 15 seconds for Ethereum. Though Ethereum is planning to move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in the coming days, the execution time for ERC20 transactions may reduce to a greater extent.
